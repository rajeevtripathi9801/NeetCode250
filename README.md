# NeetCode Pattern-Based DSA Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the **NeetCode 250** problems, organized **by problem-solving patterns** instead of random order.

The goal is not to brute-force LeetCode, but to:
- Learn core **DSA patterns**
- Recognize which pattern applies to which problem
- Write clean, efficient, and explainable solutions
- Build strong interview intuition

Each problem will include:
- A working solution
- Time and space complexity
- Notes / edge cases (where useful)

---

## Why Pattern-Based?

Most coding interview problems are variations of a **small set of patterns**:
Two pointers, sliding window, stack, binary search, trees, graphs, DP, and so on.  
If you master the patterns, new problems stop feeling random.

## Repository Structure

Each pattern has its own folder:

- arrays-and-hashing  
- two-pointers  
- sliding-window  
- stack  
- binary-search  
- linked-list  
- trees  
- tries  
- heap-priority-queue  
- backtracking  
- graphs  
- advanced-graphs  
- 1d-dp  
- 2d-dp  
- greedy  
- intervals  
- bit-manipulation  
- math-and-geometry  

Inside each folder:
- One file per problem (or subfolder per problem)
- Clean implementation
- Optional notes / explanation
